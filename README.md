**A Python script for real-time face detection and stylized painting using OpenCV.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

This project uses OpenCV (cv2) to capture video from a webcam, detect faces in real-time, and apply a stylized painting effect to those faces.  The script leverages image processing techniques to achieve a painterly aesthetic.  It's a great example of combining computer vision and image manipulation for creative applications.  This is intended for individuals interested in computer vision, image processing, and creative coding.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time face detection from webcam feed.
- Stylized painting effect applied to detected faces.
- Uses OpenCV for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- Simple and easy to run.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Library:** OpenCV (cv2)


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (tested with 3.7+)
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rithaa24/Face-cognitive-painting-cv.git
   cd Face-cognitive-painting-cv
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python cam.py.py
   ```

   This will start your webcam and apply the painting effect to detected faces.  You may need to adjust the script based on your specific camera configuration.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
Face-cognitive-painting-cv/
├── cam.py.py          # Main script for face detection and painting
├── Pictures/           # Directory to store example images (optional)
├── Paintings/          # Directory to store output images (optional - created during execution)
└── README.md          # This file
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The script's behavior is primarily hardcoded within `cam.py.py`.  Further configuration options could be added by modifying the script directly.  No external configuration files are used.


## 🧪 Testing

Testing isn't explicitly implemented in this project.  The functionality can be verified by running the script and observing the output on your screen.  The accuracy of face detection depends on the capabilities of the OpenCV library.
